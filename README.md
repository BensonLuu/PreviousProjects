INFO 330 Database:  
    My team created an eSports database from scratch using SQL server. For this project, I also acted as team lead, meaning that I logged every bit of work the team did, attended SCRUM meetings with the professor to report our progress, and organized team meetings, among other things. I developed a deep appreciation for designing databases through entity relationship diagrams, and making sure that finding information was logical. I had never done any SQL prior to this class, but I really got the hang of the entire database creation process, from planning and design, to stored procedures, business rules, and computed columns. There's no way to access the database outside of the university, but the source code is included in this repository.

Lodestar:

    Lodestar was a team project that ranked within the top 3 out of 21 projects in my INFO 200 class. Our task to prototype any kind of mobile app. Our group decided to create an app that would allow users to control their time spent on their phones to hopefully make sure they don't spend too much time on social media, games, or other time sinks. We also included pages for redeeming gift cards, planning events, and a leaderboard to compare with friends. I learned to think more carefully about user interaction, especially in terms of navigating through pages as we had many rounds of testers who couldn't figure out how to do certain tasks. 

Life Expectancy:

    Life Expectancy was a data visualization created for my INFO 201 class. Our assignment was to search for different sources of data, decide whether or not the source was truthful/ethical, and if it was, present three different visualizations based on it. Throughout the class, I not only learned how to create visualizations and sorting/filtering/otherwise altering data for different views, but also what went into a *good* data visualization. I told myself to answer questions about my visualizations' interactivity, accuracy, and most of all, provocativity.

    ALTERNATIVE was another prototype mobile design that I did with the same group as Lodestar, but for a hackathon rather than a class. The goal was to design a mobile app that focused on sustainability. We created an app that would let businesses reward points to customers if they used reusable items, such as bags or straws, for example. The business would count up the number of reusable items, then scan the customer's QR code and send them points. Customers could then redeem the points in the form of coupons, which would draw more people into the business as well. During the project, I learned to consider the business side of apps, making sure there was a way for the client to benefit from using our app. I also learned the importance of concise presentations, as our group stumbled a bit over our script, and went over the time limit.
